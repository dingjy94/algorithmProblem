### Comparator:
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html>
- **int compare(T o1, T o2):** return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
- **boolean equals(Object obj):** Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this comparator. True only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as this comparator.
